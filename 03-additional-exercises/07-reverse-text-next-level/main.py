ADDITIONAL EXERCISE

This exercise kinda builds on top of the previous one - i.e. "06-reverse-text".

Although we haven't gone through it, you are actually able to loop through a
string backwards when adding a colon (":") and a minus one ("-1") when getting
a range of a string.

So, if one wanted to reverse a string easily then one would just code the following:

  reverse_name = "Jonas"[::-1]

Given that info, your job now is to create a similar function to that in exercise 06
that'll reverse a string given to the function when calling it
