ADDITIONAL EXERCISE

This exercise builds on top of the "03-basic-calculator" exercise.

And so, in this exercise you'll just need to ask the user for both
the two integers and operator that'll be supplied to your calculator.

* HINT *
- use Pythons built-in "input" function to ask the user for integers
  and operator to use
- remember to type cast the numbers provided to the input function
