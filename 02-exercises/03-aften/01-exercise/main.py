"""
EXERCISE 1:

First create the following 2 variables:
- One named "name" initialized to your name
- One named "age" initialized to your age

Then code the below print statement using the two variables:
- print("Hi, my name is " + name + " and I'm " + age + " years old.")

As you'll see this will give your a "TypeError" .. try looking up the error before you proceed!

Lastly, fix the error by using the "str" constructor function around the "age" variable reference in the print function
