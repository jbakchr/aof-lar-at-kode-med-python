Given that we now know how to use arithmetic and assignment operators in Python you
now be able to combine both of these in your code.

In this exercise you are, therefore, to:
- 1) Create 2 integer variables with numbers of your liking
- 2) Assign the multiplication of these two variables and add the result to the first variable
- 3) Print the value of your first variable
