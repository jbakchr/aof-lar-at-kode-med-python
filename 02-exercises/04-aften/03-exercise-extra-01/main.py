EXTRA EXERCISE

In this exercise I've provided you with a function that compares to integers
and returns True if the provided numbers are equal.

Your your job is to:
- 1)  Create two integer variables and assign them some numbers
- 2)  Create a similar function like mine that uses the "not equal" operator to return False
      if the provided numbers are NOT equal
- 3)  print the result of calling your function
"""


# Equal function provided by Jonas
def equal_function(num1, num2):
    return num1 == num2


# Create your own "not equal function" below this line


# Create 2 integer variables called "num1" and "num2" below this line


# Call your function like I do it below my function call
print(equal_function(num1, num2))
