Recap from first night lecture:

- 1) Print something with the "print" function - use both double and single quotes
- 2) Clear the terminal
- 3) Break your code, run it again and try to understand the error message (Google it!)
- 4) Fix your code
- 5) Learn to look up stuff in the Python documentation https://www.python.org/

print("Hello world in double quotes!")
