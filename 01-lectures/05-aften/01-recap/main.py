# RECAP 1 - OPERATORS

# Arithmetic operators (some of them ..)
ex1 = 20 + 10
ex2 = 20 - 10
ex3 = 20 * 10
ex4 = 20 / 10


# Assignment operators (some of them ..)
ex5 = 10

ex5 += 20   # sum = 30
ex5 -= 10   # sum = 20
ex5 *= 2    # sum = 40
ex5 /= 4    # sum = 10


# Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
ex6 = 4 == 4  # True
ex7 = 4 != 4  # False
ex8 = 5 > 4   # True
ex9 = 5 < 4   # False


# Logical operators ("and", "or", "not")
ex10 = 4 == 4 and 4 != 5  # True
ex11 = 4 == 4 or 4 != 4   # True
ex11 = not 4 == 4         # False
